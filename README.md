# GameJoltAPI Panel
A slick way for developers to test achievments and scores
##  Note
This tool CANNOT be used for cheating in GameJolt games. Some people may think that that's because we designed it that way, but no. In fact, cheating would be an extra bullet point! The only way you can use it with Game ID and a private key. THAT'S ALSO THE EXACT REASON WHY THE ID IS PRIVATE!
